Despite facing various industry challenges, the company continues to innovate and strive to enhance its business performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Archied disclosed that Intiland&#8217;s performance in 2023 improved relatively compared to the previous year.

It may not be easy, but we believe we can execute the best strategies to achieve the company&#8217;s long-term goals,&#8221; said Archied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first quarter of 2024, the company recorded marketing sales of Rp232.6 billion, a decrease of 3.1% from Rp240.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023.

The high demand for properties, particularly residential products, remains a potential niche for sector growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking into account market conditions and niches, the company is preparing several significant measures to enhance sales performance, including the launch of the &#8220;Intiland Sunshine Fair&#8221; marketing promotion program. This sales promotion program offers a variety of property needs to the public, such as landed houses, apartments, SOHOs, retail spaces, warehouses, and office units.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;This year, we will focus on efforts to increase sales, especially for stock units and inventories in each project. Launching new projects remains one of the growth strategy options, as long as they are executed carefully and consider market absorption,&#8221; said Archied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The marketing campaign program, held from May to June 2024, offers various attractive deals for consumers. The launch of this program also aims to encourage people to take advantage of the Government-Borne Value Added Tax (PPN DTP) incentive program.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jakarta (30\/05) \u2013 The property development company PT Intiland Development Tbk (Intiland; DILD) held its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":28666,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[57,58],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.3 -
