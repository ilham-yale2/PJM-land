					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.intiland.com/en/intiland-and-bank-maspion-collaborate-to-held-inovator-muda-program/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Surabaya (21/06)</strong> – Property development company PT Intiland Development Tbk (Intiland:DILD) through the Intiland Foundation collaborates with <a href="https://www.bankmaspion.co.id/">PT Bank Maspion Indonesia Tbk</a> (Bank Maspion:BMAS) in the Inovator Muda program, an initiation of corporate social responsibility / CSR to empower the younger generation. This synergy was realized symbolically through the signing of a Cooperation Agreement (PKS) between Intiland Foundation and Bank Maspion which took place at Bank Maspion Head Office, Pakuwon Tower, Surabaya, East Java, Wednesday (19/06).</p>
<p>The Inovator Muda Program is a series of workshops, discussions, mentoring, and boot camp activities which will be attended by young people aged 18 to 30 years. This program aims to develop skills and provide experience in aspects of leadership, collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. The series of activities will take place in the cities of Surabaya and Trawas, Mojokerto Regency, East Java on 26 – 30 August 2024.</p>
<p>Carrying the theme &#8220;Building Futures: Youthful Harmony for Social, Economic and Environmental Innovation,&#8221; this program is a forum for participants to collaborate and create sustainable initiatives in the economic, social, and environmental fields. Based on the same vision and mission for the development of the younger generation, this synergy is a real manifestation for Intiland and Bank Maspion in holding activities together aiming at improving skills, capabilities, and igniting a spirit of positive change among the participants.</p>
<p>Intiland&#8217;s Corporate Director who is also Secretary of the Intiland Foundation, Theresia Rustandi, explained that the Young Innovator program is part of a form of CSR commitment under the umbrella of the Intiland Youth Panel program which has been running since 2018. This program aims to empower the young generation through various activities and specially designed platforms to support self-development in various aspects such as knowledge, motivation, education, investment, leadership, and career development.</p>
<p>&#8220;The synergy with Bank Maspion creates added value and a wider positive impact for our commitment and contribution to the younger generation. Young Innovators is not just an intensive training program, but also a transformative journey for the young generation to develop themselves and become capable agents of change that contribute positively to society and the environment,&#8221; said Theresia after the PKS signing procession, Wednesday (19/06).</p>
<p>The Inovator Muda Program shows Bank Maspion&#8217;s commitment to developing the quality of the nation&#8217;s young generation. As a company in the financial industry, Bank Maspion is aware of the important role and contribution of the younger generation to the nation&#8217;s economic growth, especially by riding the momentum in which Indonesia is undergoing the demographic bonus period until 2045 where 70 percent of Indonesia&#8217;s population is of productive age.</p>
<p>Bank Maspion President Director, Kasemsri Charoensiddhi believes that efforts to empower the younger generation will have a positive impact in community development while increasing competitiveness in the professional world and encouraging growth in the Indonesian economy. According to her, Indonesia needs to produce more tenacious and persistent young entrepreneurs who are able to contribute and becoming the engines to drive economic growth. Bank Maspion believes the best investment for the future is the development of human resources, especially for the younger generation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Inovator Muda Program is a form of Bank Maspion’s commitment to support the emergence of young entrepreneurs. They are the next generation who must have great mentality, knowledge, and skills to face future challenges. The young generation must be able to make a real contribution to economic development, social and environmental,&#8221; she said further.</p>
<p>This collaboration is also in line with Bank Maspion’s long-term focus and strategy to strengthen its business. According to her, as more and more young people choose the path of becoming entrepreneurs, this will be the starting point for the emergence of successful entrepreneurs in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation of Activities</strong></p>
<p>The Inovator Muda Program is planned to be held for five days in a number of locations in the cities of Surabaya and Trawas, Mojokerto, East Java. All participants who pass the selection for this program will take part in a series of activities both inside and outside the classroom, which include community development activities by going directly into the community.</p>
<p>Participation in the Inovator Muda program is open and can be joined by young people with various educational and professional backgrounds. All prospective participants who register will go through a series of selection processes.</p>
<p>Inovator Muda program is offered through two schemes for the participants, a regular self-funded application and a fully funded application presented by Intiland and Bank Maspion. Registration for self-funded participants is open from 20 June to 5 August 2024, while registration for fully funded participants is open from 20 June to 27 July 2024.</p>
<p>Registration for Inovator Muda program is done online. Self-funded registration via the link bit.ly/selffunded-InovatorMuda and fully-funded registration via the link bit.ly/fullyfunded-InovatorMuda.</p>
<p>All applicants through the fully funded scheme will undergo a selection process carried out by Intiland and Bank Maspion. The selection process includes essay writing, case study tests, and leaderless group discussions (LGD).</p>
<p>Applicants who pass the selection and will become participants in the Inovator Muda program will be announced on August 17, 2024. All participants are required to attend a briefing or onboarding session which will be held online on August 22, 2024, before the activity is carried out.</p>
<p>Theresia Rustandi explained that apart from the collaboration between Intiland and Bank Maspion, the implementation of the Inovator Muda program was also joined by a number of partners from the universities and institutions or organizations. Universities that are partners for this program include Bina Nusantara University and Surabaya University (Ubaya). Participating in the Inovator Muda program can be recognized as one of the points in student activity that will be included in the non-academic achievement record.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a property developer, Intiland does not just build property products but also strives to build a future for the younger generation. Therefore, I appreciate being able to collaborate with Bank Maspion and all partners and other stakeholders. &#8220;Let&#8217;s build synergy for a better future,&#8221; said Theresia.</p>
<p>Apart from the Inovator Muda program, Intiland previously successfully held various CSR activities for community empowerment under the umbrella of the Intiland Youth Panel program. This commitment includes, among other things, Intiland Young Leaders activities which were held in Tasola Village, North Lombok, namely a tourist village supported by the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN) in June 2022 and in the Baduy area, Kanekes Village, Lebak, Banten in August 2023.</p>
<p>These activities combine a hands-on learning approach with the values ​​of leadership and social awareness and are an effective platform for participants to increase social sensitivity. During the implementation of activities in Kanekes Village, for example, the participants made a real contribution to preserving culture and the environment, such as participating in the village clean-up program from rubbish, providing warning boards, and getting creative in making environmentally friendly waste baskets.</p>

<p><b>Performance Growth</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company interprets 2023 as a crucial moment for the national property sector&#8217;s recovery. Despite facing various industry challenges, the company continues to innovate and strive to enhance its business performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archied disclosed that Intiland&#8217;s performance in 2023 improved relatively compared to the previous year. The company recorded a gross revenue of Rp3.9 trillion, an increase of Rp758.1 billion or 24 percent compared to 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Development income contributed Rp3.1 trillion or 80.3 percent of the total, marking a 29 percent increase compared to 2022. Meanwhile, recurring income contributed Rp771 billion or 19.7 percent of the total, with this segment experiencing a 7 percent increase compared to 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archied mentioned that the challenges to be faced in 2024 are still quite significant. However, Intiland will continue to seek the best solutions to sustain long-term business growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are continuously striving to improve performance, achieve growth targets, and increase sales. It may not be easy, but we believe we can execute the best strategies to achieve the company&#8217;s long-term goals,&#8221; said Archied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first quarter of 2024, the company recorded marketing sales of Rp232.6 billion, a decrease of 3.1% from Rp240.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023. The main contributors came from sales in the landed housing segment amounting to Rp117.8 billion, mostly from the sale of housing units in Serenia Hills, Talaga Bestari, Virya Semanan, Magnolia Residence, and Tierra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mixed-use &amp; high-rise segment recorded marketing sales of Rp32.6 billion, mainly from the sale of ready-to-sell stock in high-rise projects in Jakarta and Surabaya. Meanwhile, the industrial estate development segment recorded marketing sales of Rp82.2 billion from the sale of industrial lots in Batang Industrial Park and warehouses in Aeropolis Technopark, Tangerang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are striving to achieve this year&#8217;s marketing sales targets, especially from the sale of ready-to-use units in housing and apartment projects in Jakarta, Tangerang, and Surabaya,&#8221; said Archied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the company&#8217;s gross revenue for the first quarter of 2024 amounted to Rp710.9 billion, a decrease of 53.9 percent from Rp1.54 trillion in the same period in 2023. Development income contributed Rp508.7 billion or 71.6 percent of the total gross revenue. Recurring income obtained from the investment property segment contributed Rp202.2 billion or 28.4 percent of the total gross revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company projects that the property market in 2024 will gradually improve amid various challenges. The high demand for properties, particularly residential products, remains a potential niche for sector growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking into account market conditions and niches, the company is preparing several significant measures to enhance sales performance, including the launch of the &#8220;Intiland Sunshine Fair&#8221; marketing promotion program. This sales promotion program offers a variety of property needs to the public, such as landed houses, apartments, SOHOs, retail spaces, warehouses, and office units.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This year, we will focus on efforts to increase sales, especially for stock units and inventories in each project. Launching new projects remains one of the growth strategy options, as long as they are executed carefully and consider market absorption,&#8221; said Archied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marketing campaign program, held from May to June 2024, offers various attractive deals for consumers. The launch of this program also aims to encourage people to take advantage of the Government-Borne Value Added Tax (PPN DTP) incentive program.</span></p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.intiland.com/en/supporting-ppn-incentives-intiland-presents-intiland-sunshine-fair/"><![CDATA[<p><b>Jakarta (20/05)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The property development company PT Intiland Development Tbk (Intiland; DILD) has launched a property sales promotion program titled &#8220;Intiland Sunshine Fair.&#8221; This promotion, which runs from May to June 2024, provides a great opportunity for the public to own their dream property with special offers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intiland Sunshine Fair features 21 outstanding property projects offering a variety of property products, including landed houses, apartments, offices, and shophouses (SOHO), located in Jakarta, Tangerang, and Surabaya. These diverse property offerings aim to meet the varied needs of consumers seeking quality and affordable property solutions easily and advantageously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harto Laksono, Intiland&#8217;s Marketing Director for the Surabaya region, explained that the Intiland Sunshine Fair program is intended to boost customers’ purchasing power for property products, which is showing signs of improvement. The company observes that the public&#8217;s interest in buying or investing in property tends to grow along with increasing market confidence and domestic economic stability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Intiland Sunshine Fair is not merely a property exhibition; it is a manifestation of Intiland&#8217;s commitment to providing opportunities and ease for consumers to own our property products. This theme reflects confidence, optimism, and facilitates the process of owning property. It is as if bringing sunlight to illuminate the path to the dream home,&#8221; said Harto in a written statement on Monday, (20/05)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Intiland Sunshine Fair offers numerous promotional deals for property purchases, including special discounts, prizes, and simplified purchasing processes. Consumers who purchase a property unit during this period have the opportunity to get discounts of up to 50% and win electric cars. Additionally, this program provides other exciting bonuses such as free furniture, electronic appliances, waived service charges, and shopping and dining vouchers worth tens of millions of Rupiah. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Harto Laksono, this promotional program presents a favorable opportunity for consumers to acquire Intiland property products. The public benefits from the ease of purchasing property by leveraging the Government-Borne Value Added Tax (PPN DTP) incentive program. With the tagline &#8220;Beli Properti Impian Sekarang, Bebas PPN Sampai Juni,” the Company aims to stimulate public interest and capability for investment in the property sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Value Added Tax (PPN DTP) incentive greatly helps the community in property purchases by reducing purchasing costs. We believe this policy will stimulate property market growth and provide broad economic benefits,&#8221; said Harto.</span></p>
<p><b>21 Outstanding Properties</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intiland Sunshine Fair presents 21 best properties consisting of 13 properties in Jakarta and Tangerang, as well as 8 properties in Surabaya. In Jakarta, consumers have the opportunity to choose from the best properties such as Fifty Seven Promenade, Regatta, 1Park Avenue, SQ Rés, as well as Serenia Hills, Brezza, Virya Semanan, 1Park Homes, and South Grove residences. Meanwhile, for property developments in Tangerang, the company provides Aeropolis Apartments, Talaga Bestari housing, Magnolia Residence, and commercial units in Ruota in Talaga Bestari.</span></p>

These property developments consist of Graha Natura, Aurora SOHO Graha Natura, The Rosebay, Praxis apartments and offices, Sumatra36, Spazio Tower offices, Tierra SOHO Avenue, and commercial units in Plaza Segi 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harto Laksono revealed that for the Intiland Sunshine Fair program, the company offers numerous promotions and purchasing conveniences across all projects. For landed house products, the company provides a variety of marketing gimmicks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchasing a housing unit in the prestigious Lily by The Lake cluster, Graha Natura will receive a free administrative transfer of ownership fees and a free canopy. Free canopy facilities are also provided for buyers of house units in the Morning Glory cluster, Graha Natura, Surabaya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnolia Residence in Tangerang offers special prices starting from Rp500 million and free PPN. Virya Semanan, a private cluster development in West Jakarta, also provides free PPN facilities for every unit purchase. Serenia Hills housing offers a 50% reduction in the Acquisition Duty of Right on Land and Building (BPHTB) for Quantum unit purchases, while South Grove located in Lebak Bulus, South Jakarta, offers special prices for specific units and lift installations worth Rp300 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harto Laksono revealed that purchasing apartment units also comes with equally exciting promotions. Purchasing an SQ Rés apartment in Jakarta, for example, offers a chance to get discounts of up to Rp1 billion. Regatta apartments in Pluit, North Jakarta, offer free furniture bonuses, free PPN, branded interior promotions, and up to 15% discounts for show units.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In central Jakarta, Fifty Seven Promenade apartments offer furniture bonuses worth Rp200 million, a free one-year service charge, free PPN, and up to 23% discounts for specific units. Meanwhile, for the purchase of apartment units in Surabaya such as The Rosebay, Praxis Apartment, and Sumatra36, buyers will receive a 100% PPN-free incentive and a chance to get electric cars, shopping vouchers, interior vouchers worth Rp10 million, electronic vouchers worth Rp50 million, up to Apple iPhone Pro 15. Various attractive prizes can also be obtained in all Intiland property projects in the Surabaya area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The provision of gifts and purchase bonuses will vary for each property product. However, all promotional programs we prepare aim to facilitate consumers in owning the best Intiland properties,&#8221; he further stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also prepares special promotions for the purchase of commercial property units. Purchasing commercial units like Aurora SOHO Graha Natura and Tierra SOHO Avenue, for example, will receive business opening incentives of up to Rp100 million and free air conditioning units on each floor. Other attractive bonuses are given for the purchase of Plaza Segi 8 shophouse units, where upgrading the purchase of a 2 stories unit will receive 3 stories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also offers special deals for the purchase of office units. Consumers who buy Spazio Tower office units will receive fully furnished facilities for free, while purchases of Praxis Office units will receive semi-furnished, air conditioning, and service charge for free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harto Laksono is optimistic that the Intiland Sunshine Fair program will receive a good response from the public. Apart from offering various attractive promotions, this program enlarges the opportunity for the public to easily, quickly, and profitably own properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We launch Intiland Sunshine Fair as a form of appreciation for consumers and the community who have entrusted us all this time. Thanks to that trust, Intiland continues to grow into a better property developer and always prioritizes consumer satisfaction,&#8221; he expressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to property purchase promotions, the company also organizes various activities for children and families to enliven the Intiland Sunshine Fair program. Some of these activities include Kid&#8217;s Painting, Kid&#8217;s Cooking Class, Happy Feat Zumba Fest, and Yoga. In Surabaya, the company also holds various activities such as fun walks and pop-up stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We organize many exciting activities that can be participated in by the public and consumers with their families at selected properties in Jakarta, Tangerang, and Surabaya. We want to invite the public to come to the projects and directly experience the excellence of our properties,&#8221; said Harto Laksono.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company believes that the Intiland Sunshine Fair program will run successfully.

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.intiland.com/en/talaga-bestari-inaugurates-jami-al-kautsar-mosque/"><![CDATA[<p><b>Tangerang (5/16) – </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The property development company PT Intiland Development Tbk (Intiland; DILD), through its subsidiary PT Sinar Puspapersada, the developer of the Talaga Bestari residential area, has officially inaugurated the Jami’ Al-Kautsar Mosque in Talaga Bestari, Tangerang, Banten. This development reflects the company&#8217;s contribution, concern, and responsibility in providing worship facilities and serving as a center for religious and social activities for the Talaga Bestari residential area residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s management jointly conducted the inauguration ceremony, including Intiland&#8217;s Vice Chairman and Independent Commissioner, Dr. Sofyan A. Djalil, Independent Commissioner Thio Gwan Po Micky, and Director Permadi Indra Yoga. The event was also attended by the Chairman of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) of Tangerang, KH Ues Nawawi, and the Chairman of the Syaidaturoji Foundation, Abdul Roji. The ceremony began with Dr. Sofyan A. Djalil signing the inscription, followed by the formal handover of the mosque to the Syaidaturoji Foundation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this occasion, Permadi Indra Yoga stated that the construction of the Jami&#8217; Al-Kautsar Mosque manifests the company&#8217;s commitment and responsibility to positively impact the residents around the Talaga Bestari project. It is hoped that this mosque will enhance residents&#8217; comfort in performing their religious duties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have captured the aspirations and needs of the residents regarding worship facilities, which are quite high. We hope that the Jami’ Al-Kautsar Mosque becomes a source of pride for the residents of Talaga Bestari and meets the needs of those living in the area to perform worship and social activities properly and comfortably,” said Permadi Indra Yoga in Talaga Bestari, Tangerang, on Thursday (May 16).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jami’ Al-Kautsar Mosque in Talaga Bestari is built on a 3,900 square meter plot of land and has a building area of 650 square meters, allowing it to accommodate around 600 people in the main building. The mosque&#8217;s capacity can be increased to 3,000 people by utilizing the plaza area for communal prayers during Eid al-Fitr or Eid al-Adha. The mosque has been fully operational and serving the needs of Talaga Bestari residents since the end of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jami’ Al-Kautsar Mosque boasts a unique design, as its shape resembles the Ka&#8217;bah in Mecca, aligning with the qibla direction for Muslims. The mosque&#8217;s exterior is dominated by black walls, creating a solid and elegant impression. Additionally, there are Kufi calligraphy ornaments with the word Al-Kautsar forming yellow lines reminiscent of the Kiswah, the cloth covering the Ka&#8217;bah. This design not only reinforces the mosque’s religious identity but also provides impressive aesthetics, evoking the sacredness of the Ka&#8217;bah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The simple yet beautiful mosque design is expected to become a landmark in the area. The construction of the mosque&#8217;s minaret adds an iconic touch to the building,” said Permadi Indra Yoga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jami’ Al-Kautsar Mosque is designed without interior support columns and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a domed structure. This design aims to create a spacious interior that can be optimally utilized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for worship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mosque&#8217;s ceiling is made high in response to the tropical climate, which can cause heat and humidity. A high ceiling will improve air circulation, thereby enhancing comfort and the sense of devotion during worship. This design also anticipates an increase in the number of congregants, necessitating an expansion of capacity by constructing a mezzanine floor in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The design of the mihrab, or the imam&#8217;s prayer niche, is made to resemble the Ka’bah and is open to evoke the feeling of worshiping in the Holy Land. True to its name, &#8216;Jami’ Al-Kautsar,&#8217; which means the Fountain in Paradise, we hope this mosque will be a gathering place for Muslims to worship with reverence and comfort,” said Permadi Indra Yoga.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Area Development</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talaga Bestari is one of the integrated residential area development projects spanning 270 hectares in Cikupa, Tangerang. Developed in 1997, this residential area has grown rapidly and transformed into a suburban area in recent years. The area is equipped with various supporting facilities, such as a fitness center, clubhouse, integrated school, culinary center, retail spaces, and various entertainment facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Project Leader of Talaga Bestari, Tatik Yudianti, described the location of this residential area as highly strategic and relatively accessible from Jakarta and Tangerang, including direct access to Jakarta&#8217;s central business district. Talaga Bestari is also near the Serpong-Bandara toll road, which connects to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, which is reachable by car within 30 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the future, with the operation of the Balaraja-Serpong toll road and planned as a Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) area integrated with the development plan of the Cibadak MRT station connecting Balaraja to Cikarang, which is part of the East-West MRT line, connectivity and accessibility to or from Talaga Bestari will be further enhanced,&#8221; she further explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aligned with the concept and theme of living in harmony with nature, the development of this housing area adopts eco-friendly approaches and principles by incorporating sustainable design and features. This includes the provision of green areas, a central park, and pedestrian and bicycle lanes that will connect to green spaces throughout the development area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new development of Talaga Bestari is divided into two phases. The first phase involves developing a 40-hectare township, encompassing residential, retail, food &amp; beverage establishments, and a new clubhouse facility for residents. The second phase occupies an 11-hectare plot for Transit-Oriented Development (TOD), including apartments, integrated retail, commercial spaces connected with various shuttle bus services, and Mass-Rapid Transport (MRT) stations. In addition to residential clusters, the company has previously succeeded in developing several housing clusters such as The Hills, Harmoni Selaras cluster, RE cluster, and the commercial area Jungle Walk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This area is also near shopping centers and retail outlets, such as Supermall Karawaci and Tangcity Mall. Lion City&#8217;s presence as Lion Air&#8217;s education and training center adds value to the area and enhances investment in Talaga Bestari.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Talaga Bestari offers promising prospects for the future. We will continue to develop this area in conjunction with the progress of infrastructure, transportation routes, and the direction of area development in the future.”, Tatik stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to accessibility and transportation convenience, Talaga Bestari has several area facilities for residents. Apart from places of worship, this area also features a sports club, deer park, shuttle bus service, integrated schools such as Al-Azhar Syifa Budi Talaga Bestari and Montessori School, and a 24-hour integrated security system.</span></p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.intiland.com/en/intiland-introduces-a-new-concept-of-private-office-at-spazio-tower/"><![CDATA[<p><b>Surabaya (27/03) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Property developer PT Intiland Development Tbk (Intiland; DILD) introduces a new concept of private offices at Spazio Tower, West Surabaya. This strata-title office space is designed with innovation, emphasizing privacy and office comfort for working and conducting business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located in the central business and lifestyle district of West Surabaya, Spazio Tower&#8217;s private office is an ideal choice for young entrepreneurs looking to grow their businesses. Targeting end-users such as business owners, private offices serve not only as operational spaces but also as representative offices for meeting business contacts, investors, and colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harto Laksono, Director of Marketing for Intiland in the Surabaya region, explained that private offices offer several advantages over typical office spaces. These office units provide more flexibility for tenant business activities, serving as both personal workspaces and venues for important meetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Private offices have many advantages, starting with their strategic location in the central business and lifestyle hub of West Surabaya, easy accessibility, comprehensive facilities, and operational flexibility. This office concept offers convenience, practicality, and flexibility for its users,&#8221; said Harto Laksono in Surabaya (27/3).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of private offices is one of the new services offered by the Spazio Tower building. These office units range in size from 53 square meters to 99 square meters. The smallest office unit is marketed at a starting price of Rp1.4 billion, which includes a promotional package of a free semi-furnished setup, a free service charge, and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an air conditioner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Harto Laksono, the introduction of private offices at Spazio Tower aims to meet the community&#8217;s need for office space. In addition to offering leasing services, entrepreneurs or investors can also purchase and own office units at Spazio Tower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the advantages of private office units is that buyers have the flexibility to design and customize their spaces according to their needs. Unit owners also benefit from 24-hour operational flexibility, allowing them to use their office spaces whenever necessary without additional service charges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of Spazio Tower&#8217;s development, private office owners can also access various facilities to support their businesses, including retail outlets, food and beverage options, a mini-market, a gym, Whiz Luxe Hotel, ample parking space, and high-speed internet services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spazio Tower is an integrated mixed-use development located in the Graha Famili area of West Surabaya. In addition to office facilities, Spazio Tower features retail spaces, a function hall, and a five-star hotel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harto Laksono revealed that following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of Spazio Tower has seen significant growth, especially in the number of tenants. Spazio Tower is trusted as the preferred business location across various industries, including finance, law, healthcare, and energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Most recently, Spazio Tower has also been chosen by the University of Surabaya (Ubaya) to open a new campus named Ubaya West Campus,&#8221; he further elaborated.</span></p>
<p><b>Office Market</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is observing that the development of the office segment remains quite challenging this year. Nevertheless, the company is optimistic that demand for office space rental or sales will gradually improve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are still uncertainties post-election, but positive projections regarding economic growth and the presence of political stability and security signal a recovery in the office market,” said Harto Laksono.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The office segment is one of the main businesses conducted by the company. In Surabaya, the company&#8217;s office portfolio includes Intiland Tower Surabaya and Praxis located in the city center, as well as Spazio and Spazio Tower in the West Surabaya area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this year, the average occupancy rate of the company&#8217;s office spaces has shown improvement. This positive trend is closely linked to the development plans and direction of Surabaya city. The rapid development of infrastructure and transportation has strengthened Surabaya&#8217;s position as the gateway to the economy of Eastern Indonesia.</span></p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.intiland.com/en/intiland-and-saltware-collaborate-to-develop-smart-farming/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jakarta (05/01) – </strong>Property developer company PT Intiland Development Tbk (Intiland; DILD) is supporting the growth of the national agricultural industry, aligning with the Government&#8217;s efforts to boost this sector. This support is materialized through Intiland&#8217;s collaboration with Saltware Co. Ltd. (Saltware) in implementing smart farming technology on several productive lands owned by Intiland. The collaboration was symbolically marked by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Intiland and Saltware at the Presidential Staff Office, Bina Graha Building, Jakarta, on Friday (5/1), witnessed by The Chief of Staff to the President and Chairman of the Indonesian Farmers Association (HKTI) General (ret.) Dr. Moeldoko.</p>
<p>Hendro S. Gondokusumo, the Founder and CEO of PT Intiland Development Tbk, believes that the agricultural sector is not only the backbone of the nation&#8217;s food but also plays a significant role in the economy. Therefore, Hendro mentioned Intiland&#8217;s contribution as a property developer in supporting the agrarian sector by providing optimal land for agricultural productivity.</p>
<p>&#8220;By integrating land development with agriculture, Intiland is not only enhancing agricultural productivity but also supporting job creation, local economic growth, and national food self-sufficiency. Agricultural industry players can utilize existing land sustainably, including employing modern technology to maximize agricultural yields,&#8221; said Hendro S. Gondokusumo after the MoU signing event.</p>
<p>Dr. Lee Jeong Kun, Chairman, Founder, and CEO of Saltware, expressed a similar opinion. He stated that high-value crop cultivation like strawberries in Indonesia could utilize smart farming combined with Korean IT technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the pilot cultivation is successful, we plan to spread the standard strawberry smart farm model to all regions of Indonesia, allowing many Indonesian people to taste delicious Korean strawberries,&#8221; said Dr. Lee Jeong Kun.</p>
<p>Saltware, a South Korean public company in the technology sector, has a portfolio including cloud service, infrastructure service, enterprise portal, and digital farming. Saltware has been instrumental in creating advanced solutions for agriculture using integrated Internet of Things (IoT) technology.</p>
<p>Generally, IoT technology aids farmers in monitoring real-time environmental conditions, providing detailed information on humidity levels, temperature, and soil conditions. With this accurate information, farmers can adjust water usage more efficiently, reducing its consumption without compromising plant health.</p>
<p>&#8220;This advantage not only reduces water usage costs but also supports essential water resource conservation in hot climatic areas,&#8221; said Dr. Lee Jeong Kun.</p>
<p>Dr. Lee Jeong Kun further added that one of Saltware&#8217;s business services is developing technology for smart farming, utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) software in the agricultural sector. The aim of smart farming development is to assist in optimal crop cultivation processes and maximize product yields. Partnering with Intiland is expected to increase technology penetration and outsourcing processes in the Southeast Asian region, especially in Indonesia.</p>
<p>The two companies plan to set up a pilot smart farm in Indonesia, with the aim of identifying potential issues with strawberry cultivation ahead of time and promote trial cultivation. They also intend to produce virus-free strawberry seedlings in plant factories with automated control technology under LED artificial lights, Additionally, they will build greenhouse for the trial cultivation of strawberries in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Through such pilot cultivation, they announced plans to develop a standard model for strawberry greenhouses in Indonesia. This includes determining the optimal geographical location for strawberry cultivation and managing of heating and cooling systems. The model would then be jointly distributed not only in Indonesia but also in Southeast Asia regions such as Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
<p>The MOU between Korea&#8217;s Saltware and Indonesia&#8217;s Intiland is part of a project aimed at promoting agricultural technology exchange between Korea and Indonesia. In Indonesia, not only strawberries but also main crops such as rice and corn for self-sufficiency demand cooperation with saltware. To achieve this, the two companies have agreed to progress the project in stages, differentiating short-term and long-term crop projects.</p>
<p>According to Hendro S. Gondokusumo, the smart farming development collaboration with Saltware is part of Intiland&#8217;s business growth strategy. Through this partnership, the company can increase the value of assets from the land and buildings it owns. This expansion also represents Intiland&#8217;s contribution to supporting the Government&#8217;s program in strengthening national food security.</p>
<p>&#8220;Intiland&#8217;s main business remains in the property sector. This collaboration is more a form of commitment and contribution from us to strengthen food security through technology utilization and to enhance the value of the land and buildings we have owned,&#8221; expressed Hendro S. Gondokusumo.</p>
<p>The smart farming development collaboration between Intiland and Saltware is planned to be executed gradually. As an initial pilot project, both companies will conduct smart farming development trials for strawberry cultivation in Intiland&#8217;s development projects.</p>
<p>Intiland and Saltware will establish joint operational cooperation to formulate plans for implementing smart farming, methods for cultivating strawberries and other food crops, and subsequent strategic plans. This collaboration is a progressive step in supporting the transformation of the agricultural sector in Indonesia through technology utilization as a key element in achieving food security and sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Based on studies by several institutions, it is known that the productivity issues of agricultural land have become a primary focus in Indonesia. Its significant impact on increasing food demand alongside population growth is considered a serious challenge.</p>
<p>The conversion of land from agriculture to property or industrial use has somewhat affected local and national food availability. The role of information technology utilization is crucial in driving innovation in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the Government has expressed, agricultural transformation is the key solution to address the regeneration challenges faced by farmers, which currently pose a threat to the agricultural sector. Considering this situation, we support the Government&#8217;s efforts to involve the younger generation in the transformation process by leveraging artificial intelligence and modern technology as a new foundation in agriculture,&#8221; said Hendro S. Gondokusumo.</p>
<p>The utilization of digital technology, especially in producing and assembling new varieties, has rapidly evolved as an effort to counter climate change that can reduce land productivity. The need for modern approaches like smart farming is increasingly urgent in changing the pattern of agricultural land use. The paradigm shift from conventional farming to technology-driven approaches like IoT and AI is believed to be the key to the future of the national agricultural sector.</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.intiland.com/en/poins-becomes-the-new-culinary-hub-destination-in-the-lebak-bulus-tod-area/"><![CDATA[<p><b>Jakarta (29/12) – </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) area in Lebak Bulus, South Jakarta, is progressing rapidly. Its strategic location, supported by easy access to various modes of public transportation, has made this area a preferred choice for residents to live, work, play, and meet diverse urban lifestyle needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This transformation can be seen in the development of Poins as an integrated commercial center in the area. Poins has evolved beyond just a shopping center into a melting pot and transit mall, particularly for users of the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system traveling to and from Lebak Bulus MRT station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poins has now become one of the new culinary destinations in the Lebak Bulus TOD area. This shopping center has launched a new one-floor food court facility that offers many renowned cafes and restaurants with a variety of delicious dishes that stimulate the appetite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choices depend on personal preference. Various renowned cafes and restaurants are present at Poins to fulfill culinary adventures for families and the Jakarta community and its surroundings. In addition to Imperial Kitchen and Fish &amp; Cheap, some favorite cafes and restaurants are present at Poins, such as Mixue, Reddog, Kopi Kenangan, Tomoro Coffee, Warung Mie Jowo, and Penyetan Cok.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only in the food court area on the 3rd floor, but also cafe and restaurant options are spread across the Lower Ground (LG), Ground Floor (GF), Upper Ground (UG), and 1st floor. Some well-known restaurants are already in operation, including KFC, Konnichiwa Coffee, Hoka-Hoka Bento, Janji Jiwa, Rice Bowl, Cuppa Coffee, AW Restaurant, Mister Baso, Hana Restaurant, Madame Don, Cali Deli, Friends With Bru, and Bakmi Kelinci.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Permadi Indra Yoga, the Director of Poins and the Director of Business Development at PT Intiland Development Tbk revealed several reasons why Poins has become a favorite culinary destination in the Lebak Bulus TOD area. One of them is the accessibility facilitated by a 307.5-meter-long sky bridge connecting the food court floor to the Transit Plaza and Lebak Bulus MRT Station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This facility facilitates people from various areas to reach Poins. It only takes about five minutes from Lebak Bulus MRT Station through a safe and comfortable skybridge access equipped with escalators and lifts. The second factor is the abundance of cafes and restaurants offering a variety of menu options at relatively affordable prices. The shopping convenience factor is the third reason that makes Poins the top choice for culinary destinations in the Lebak Bulus TOD Area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We aim to provide various lifestyle facilities for comfort and to meet the needs of the community. All of this is to strengthen Poins&#8217; position as a comfortable modern destination and transit mall in the Lebak Bulus TOD area,&#8221; expressed Permadi Indra Yoga in a written statement on Friday (29/12).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to offering a variety of cafes and restaurants, Poins also provides entertainment facilities for visitors. A cinema operated by CGV Cinemas on the 3rd floor and a karaoke facility on the 5th floor further complement the community&#8217;s entertainment needs and lifestyle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poins is a one-stop shopping destination that includes a shopping center, retail outlets, a hotel, and a 15-story apartment complex. This shopping center is also known as one of the electronic, mobile phone, computer, and camera hubs in South Jakarta. Poins also features the Grand Whiz Poins Simatupang Hotel, a four-star hotel managed by the Intiwhiz hotel network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The other advantage of Poins is the availability of a well-integrated transit plaza with the TOD (Transit-Oriented Development) area of Lebak Bulus. This facility facilitates accessibility between Poins, Lebak Bulus MRT Station, and reaching other public transportation modes such as Trans Jakarta buses, taxis, and online motorcycle taxis,&#8221; he further stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entrance of Diamond Supermarket as the main tenant or anchor tenant also serves as a magnet for visitors. Providing a variety of quality products, Diamond Supermarket offers a comprehensive and relatively affordable shopping experience for the community and residents around the TOD area of Lebak Bulus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our commitment is to continue making Poins a leading destination for the people of Jakarta and an integral part of the development of the TOD area in Lebak Bulus,&#8221; said Permadi Indra Yoga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poins is developed by PT Inti Menara Jaya, a joint venture between PT Intiland Development Tbk and PT Menara Prambanan. This strategic collaboration encompasses ownership, management, and development aspects of Poins, particularly in retail and commercial facilities and areas.</span></p>
<p><b>Development Strategy of TOD</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company recognizes that the development of TOD areas is an integral part of modern urban development. TOD areas hold high value because they prioritize the concepts of connectivity, accessibility, and walkability, addressing the urban community&#8217;s need for a better quality of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We aim to create TOD areas that are not only comfortable living spaces but also active, interconnected, comfortable, and sustainable communities for every individual residing there,&#8221; said Permadi Indra Yoga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intiland has identified the development of TOD areas as a crucial priority for long-term development, emphasizing three main aspects: convenience, accessibility, and community amenities. The concept of convenience provides ease and comfort of accessibility for residents and users of TOD areas to various key points, including public transportation, shopping centers, and other public facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the concept of accessibility emphasizes well-connected and integrated urban life. Everything is designed to support the creation of an efficient and interconnected life through the availability of easy transportation access, comfortable pedestrian pathways, and adequate connectivity between residential zones, commercial areas, and public facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important concept is community amenities, which means forming an inclusive and sustainable community. The company pays special attention to providing facilities and amenities for the community, including open areas, parks, sports facilities, educational centers, and easily accessible healthcare services. The concept of a sustainable and self-sufficient community can be realized through efforts to create an environmentally friendly environment, use green technology, and promote sustainable practices to create a balanced and enduring environment for its residents.</span></p>

This golf tournament will conclude with a gala dinner event along with the awarding and distribution of prizes to the winners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The gala dinner serves as the highlight of our celebration and a night of appreciation for the golf players and members. This event provides an opportunity to meet, foster camaraderie, and build connections among the golf enthusiasts,” Simon further expressed.</span></p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.intiland.com/en/mitbana-and-intiland-launch-green-bestari-park/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>A township inspired by nature in the heart of West Tangerang, Banten</strong></p>
<p><strong>Banten (5/9) &#8211; </strong>Mitbana, together with PT Sinar Puspapersada, a subsidiary of PT. Intiland Development Tbk, has launched Green Bestari Park, a 51-hectare integrated township and Transit Oriented Development (TOD) located in Talaga Bestari in Tangerang, Greater Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>
<p>The joint venture company, PT. Inti Mitbana Development, will develop Green Bestari Park in three phases. The first phase is a 14-hectare area that includes cluster landed homes, retail areas, a town centre with F&amp;B outlets, and a new clubhouse for residents. The subsequent phases of development will include residences, a city park, commercial areas, and a TOD integrated with the future Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station along the East-West MRT line connecting Balaraja and Cikarang.</p>
<p>Mitbana, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and Surbana Jurong, is the 70 percent majority shareholder of the joint venture. Leveraging Mitsubishi Corporation’s experience in urban development in Japan and Indonesia, as well as Surbana Jurong’s expertise in planning and designing urban and infrastructure projects globally, Mitbana will oversee the masterplan, urban design and planning of the development, together with Intiland overseeing the land preparation, infrastructure development and local stakeholder engagements for the project.</p>
<p><strong>About Green Bestari Park</strong></p>
<p>Green Bestari Park’s prime location provides residents with convenient access to both existing amenities in Talaga Bestari, and future amenities that will be built in the township in the coming years. The development is well served with roads that enhance its connectivity and accessibility to key landmarks. It is strategically located within a one-minute drive from the East Balaraja toll gate, providing convenient access to and from Jakarta and Tangerang, as well as direct access to Jakarta’s Sudirman Central Business District within a 50-minute drive. The development is also close to the Serpong-Airport Toll Road that connects to Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport within a 45-minute drive.</p>
<p>Green Bestari Park features a “5G” design concept, creating a sustainable and vibrant lifestyle for its residents. The 5Gs are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Green Reserve: The verdant greenery of the city park, jungle boulevard and Sakura boulevard provide a sanctuary of natural beauty within the urban landscape.</li>
<li>Green Connection: The green loop boulevard, direct access to toll roads and future MRT station offer convenient access and seamlessly connect residents to amenities.</li>
<li>Green Lifestyle: Robust commercial facilities including the clubhouse and town center provide a vibrant and fulfilling lifestyle for residents.</li>
<li>Greenovation: The township champions eco-innovation and features green innovative designs, inspiring residents to adopt an environmentally conscious lifestyle.</li>
<li>Green Community: The environment connects people to nature, nurturing community bonds through a shared appreciation for the outdoors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Incorporating these five pillars, Green Bestari Park harmoniously blends nature, convenience, innovation, and community, setting a new standard for contemporary urban living.</p>
<p>Masterplanned by Surbana Jurong, Green Bestari Park aims to pioneer energy conservation and sustainable living in Talaga Bestari. The integrated township will feature water-sensitive urban designs such as over four hectares of green spaces that improve rainwater absorption, as well as electrical vehicle charging stations.</p>
<p>Mr Permadi Indra Yoga, Intiland’s Executive Director of Business Development, said, “Together with Mitbana, our shared aspiration is to create a leading sustainable development that rejuvenates the Talaga Bestari area and foster the building of an inclusive social community. The innovations planned in this township are designed to resonate with the preferences of younger generation, particularly those who aspire to reside in an eco-conscious community, while being close to urban conveniences. We hope that many will choose to embrace Green Bestari Park as their home.”</p>
<p>Daisuke Kobayashi, President Director of PT. Inti Mitbana Development, and Deputy Chief Operating Officer of Mitbana, said, “Our vision for Green Bestari Park extends to redefining the next generation of sustainable urban living in Greater Jakarta. Future developments in Green Bestari Park, such as the TOD and Green Connection, cultivate a lifestyle that harmonises with the environment while offering utmost convenience for our residents. Green Bestari Park makes an appealing choice for homebuyers seeking convenience from the existing modern amenities in Talaga Bestari and the promise of an enriched and eco-conscious living environment in the future.”</p>
